         </h3>
         <div>
            <p>For the runtime files for the iXML processor and a sample <em>j</em>ωiXML application see <a href="https://github.com/johnlumley/jwiXML">here</a>.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>This workbench runs <i>entirely</i> within the browser client, using <a href="https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-js/documentation2/index.html">SaxonJS </a>as the top-level
               program and the <i>jwiXML</i> JavaScript library. There is <i>no</i> server-side processing, apart from
               initial delivery of necessary files.</p>
            <p>You can input and edit an iXML grammar either <i>ab initio</i> or by loading from a file on your computer
               or one of the test-case or sample grammars from the <a href="https://github.com/invisibleXML/ixml">iXML
                  GitHub repository</a>. The input string can also be edited or loaded from file or, in the case of a
               test-case or sample grammar, by selecting from one of a number of provided input strings, relevant to the
               grammar in question.</p>
            <p>Local file selection is either by a conventional selector dialog or by drag-and-drop of a file onto the
               relevant text area. (Note that on Firefox security hurdles may preclude drag-and-drop.)</p>

            <a id="d2e84">Editing grammars and inputs</a>
         </h3>
         <div>
            <p>iXML grammars are edited in the upper textarea, where usual keystokes are supported, but there is no
               'syntax awareness' during input:</p>
            <img width="400" src="img1.png"/>
            <p>The 'format' button above the textarea will, for a valid grammar, 'pretty-print' by replacing the text
               with a canonical ixml rendering of the parsed grammar. This form will line up all the rules so their
               definitions are all left-aligned. Alternatives use the vertical bar ('|') as a separator, even if the
               original used a semi-colon. </p>
            <p>Input strings to be parsed by that grammar are edited in the lower text-area:</p>
            <img width="300" src="img2.png"/>
            <p>The size of both of the textareas can be adjusted (at least on Chrome and Firefox) by the resizer
               'chevron' at the lower right hand corner.</p>

         <p>With the grammar and potential input string edited, clicking on the GO! button causes the following

            <h4>
               <a id="d2e111">Parsing and compiling the grammar</a>
            </h4>
            <p>The grammar defined by the text in the Grammar window is parsed and compiled as an iXML grammar to
               produce an internal object representing the compiled grammar. Assuming the grammar has valid iXML syntax,
               this is then displayed in the 'Parse Grammar' section (which is normally hidden - just click on the
               show/hide to reveal).</p>
            <p> Here various projections of the grammar can be displayed either in XML format or an iXML textual
               serialisation. Either the original parsed grammar or the compilation (i.e. where the grammar has been
               reduced to a canonical form) thereof can be shown.:</p>

            <p>As with the parsed grammar, if you want to copy the resulting XML, the 'select result' button will select
               the whole of the result XML (and multiples if ambiguous or record-oriented processing was performed), so

               <a id="d2e239">Input parsing errors</a>
            </h4>
            <p>The parsing of an input string against a valid iXML grammar can fail for a number of reasons. Such errors
               are displayed in the 'Result' portion of the workbench, currently as, in line with the specification, an
               XML document with <code>@ixml:state="failed"</code> on the topmost element, such as:</p>
            <pre class="parseFailure">&lt;ixml xmlns:ixml="http://invisiblexml.org/NS" ixml:state="failed"&gt;
Failure at line 1 column 2
Given '/' (codepoint 47). Expecting one of:
   "+" {#8: sum: term, "+", term++"+".},
   "×" {#10: product: term, "×", operand.},

Input:
   a/b
    ^
&lt;/ixml&gt;</pre>
            <p>where an unexpected (operator) character was encountered. In this case the processor attempts to identify
               what characters would have been admissable at this point in the parse, and in which rules (identified by
               line number and with original source) the parse failed. (This is currently not available for
               internally-generated rules, such as those for repetition constructs.) </p>
            <p>In cases of high potential ambiguity, such as the grammar:</p>
            <pre>specification: "{", rule*, "}".
rule: definition*.
definition: id, "=", value.
id:[L].
value:[N].</pre>
            <p>when run with an input that can trigger such ambiguity, such as <code>{}</code> (possible solutions could
               include no rule or a potentially infinite sequence of rules each containing no definitions) the
                  <em>j</em>ωiXML processor can get into an infinite loop. Internally there is a limit of triggering
               1000 productions on processing a character from the input string. If this limit it reached a failure will
               assumed: </p>

            <p>The input string may have parsed correctly, but it is still possible that the conversion (serialisation)
               to XML fails as the resulting tree would not be a valid XML document. In such cases the error is
               reported, again in the 'Result' section:</p>
            <pre class="parseFailure">&lt;ixml xmlns:ixml="http://invisiblexml.org/NS" ixml:state="failed"&gt;
An attribute node may not be the final parse result @input&lt;/ixml&gt;</pre>

                  <td>If checked, marks for ignore ('-'), attribute ('@') or insertion ('+') serialisation are not
                     honoured but rather placed on the full parse tree output either as an <code>@ixml:mark</code>
                     attribute or an <code>ixml:insert</code> element. This ony applies to marks on the original grammar
                     and not to artefactual marks, such as those used for generated non-terminals implementing
                     optionality or repetition.</td>

         </h3>
         <p>Both grammar and input texts can be read from local filestore by using the appropriate 'Choose file' (or
            'Browse') button, which permits a file to be read and its text loaded into the textarea. The name of the
            file loaded is displayed next to the file chooser. Files can also be 'drag-and-dropped' onto the textarea,
            though in Firefox security settings will probably have to be altered (it seems to work fine in Chrome).</p>
         <img width="300" src="img8.png"/>
         <p>Grammars can also be loaded from web-repositories, in particular from the <a href="https://github.com/invisiblexml/ixml/">InvisibleXML test-suites or sample grammars</a> using the
            Grammar 'Test/sample' dropdown:</p>
         <img width="300" src="img9.png"/>
         <p>A <a href="https://invisiblexml.org/test-catalog/">browsable catalog</a> of the test suite is also
            available.</p>
         <p>When there are sample inputs available for one of these test or sample grammars, the 'Test/Sample' dropdown
            above the Input textarea will be populated.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>Note that some of these test cases provide the iXML grammar in its XML serialisation form. The workbench
               recognises such a situation and will show and use that form, but editing in the textarea under these
               circumstances will have <em>no effect on the grammar being used in parsing</em>. Files containing iXML
               grammars serialised as XML loaded by other means (file selection, drag-and-drop) will be (currently)
               treated as simple text and currently will therefore fail to be parsed. (The <a href="https://github.com/johnlumley/jwiXML">jwlProcessor.xsl</a> library contains a
                  <code>jwl:parseXML()</code> function that <strong>will</strong> accept XML-serialised grammars)</p>
